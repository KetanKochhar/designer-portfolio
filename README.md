Why I created this 

I have designed a beautiful webpage as a portfolio for my talented cousin, who is a skilled graphics designer. This webpage showcases her exceptional work, consisting of seven captivating pictures, all of which were meticulously created by her. While creating this webpage, I felt a strong desire to contribute something meaningful to someone's success, which motivated me to embark on this project. However, I must admit that currently, the webpage only allows for one-way interaction, as I haven't yet developed a backend system for her to effortlessly upload new projects. Rest assured, I am dedicated to expanding this webpage by learning how to create a backend, enabling her to effortlessly showcase her latest projects without the need for any code editing.

How to use this

To use this webpage, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the provided zip file.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a desired location on your computer.
3. Locate the "index.html" file in the extracted folder.
4. Double-click on the "index.html" file to open it in a web browser.

Once the webpage is open, you can explore the design and layout created for my cousin's portfolio. The seven images displayed on the webpage are placeholders and can be replaced with anyone's actual project images. Here's how you can update the images:

1. Open the extracted folder and locate the "img" folder.
2. Within the "img" folder, you will find the placeholder images used in the webpage.
3. Choose the desired replacement images for your cousin's projects.
4. Rename the new images to match the names of the existing placeholder images. Make sure to keep the same file format (e.g., .jpg, .png).
5. Replace the placeholder images with the renamed images in the "images" folder.

Once the images have been replaced, refresh the webpage in your browser (if it's already open) to see the updated project images.

Please note that the current text and images displayed on the webpage are just for demonstration purposes. To respect your cousin's work and privacy, it's important to obtain her consent before displaying her actual projects on the webpage.
