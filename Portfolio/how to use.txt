Once the webpage is open, you can explore the design and layout created for my cousin's portfolio. The seven images displayed on the webpage are placeholders and can be replaced with anyone's actual project images. Here's how you can update the images:

1. Open the extracted folder and locate the "img" folder.
2. Within the "img" folder, you will find the placeholder images used in the webpage.
3. Choose the desired replacement images for your cousin's projects.
4. Rename the new images to match the names of the existing placeholder images. Make sure to keep the same file format (e.g., .jpg, .png).
5. Replace the placeholder images with the renamed images in the "images" folder.

Once the images have been replaced, refresh the webpage in your browser (if it's already open) to see the updated project images.
