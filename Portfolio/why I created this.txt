I have designed a beautiful webpage as a portfolio for my talented cousin, who is a skilled graphics designer. This webpage showcases her exceptional work, consisting of seven captivating pictures, all of which were meticulously created by her. While creating this webpage, I felt a strong desire to contribute something meaningful to someone's success, which motivated me to embark on this project. However, I must admit that currently, the webpage only allows for one-way interaction, as I haven't yet developed a backend system for her to effortlessly upload new projects. Rest assured, I am dedicated to expanding this webpage by learning how to create a backend, enabling her to effortlessly showcase her latest projects without the need for any code editing.
